# ðŸ’¡Observability
Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, including logs, metrics, and traces. It tells "**Why** it is happening".  

**logs**: Involves the collection of log data from various components of a system. Logging explains why it is happening.  
**metrics**: Involves tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance and send alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions. Main focus is "What is happening".  
**Traces**: Involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system. Tracing shows "how it is happening".  



# ðŸ’¡Monitoring
Monitoring focuses on tracking system's health and performance through metrics (like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance) and raise alerts when something goes wrong. It tells " **What** is happening". It is a part of observability.

# ðŸ’¡Monitoring vs Observability 

| Category       | Monitoring                                   | Observability                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**          | Checking if everything is working as expected else raising alerts| Understanding why things are happening in the system, Identifying the root cause |
| **Data**           | Collects metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and error rates | Collects logs, metrics, and traces to provide a full picture |
| **Example**        | If a server's CPU usage goes above 90%, monitoring will alert us | If a website is slow, observability helps us trace the user's request through different services to find the bottleneck |
| **Benefit**        | Identifies potential issues before they become critical  | Helps diagnose issues and understand system behavior |
| **Tools**          | Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Zabbix, PRTG  | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, FluentBit, Kibana) Splunk, Jaeger, Zipkin, New Relic, Dynatrace, Datadog |

# ðŸ’¡Monitoring and Observability Scenarios

## Monitoring scenarios
- **Infrastructure**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
- **Applications**: Response times, error rates, throughput.
- **Databases**: Query performance, connection pool usage, transaction rates.
- **Network**: Latency, packet loss, bandwidth usage.
- **Security**: Unauthorized access attempts, vulnerability scans, firewall logs.

## Observability scenarios
- **Logs**: Detailed records of events and transactions within the system.
- **Metrics**: Quantitative data points like CPU load, memory consumption, and request counts.
- **Traces**: Data that shows the flow of requests through various services and components.
