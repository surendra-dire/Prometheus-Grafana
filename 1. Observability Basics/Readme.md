# ðŸ’¡Observability
Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, including logs, metrics, and traces. It tells " **Why** it is happening".  

**logs**: Involves the collection of log data from various components of a system. Logging explains why it is happening.  
**metrics**: Involves tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance and send alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions. Main focus is "What is happening".  
**Traces**: Involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system. Tracing shows "how it is happening".  

**Goal**: 

# ðŸ’¡Monitoring
Monitoring focuses on tracking system's health and performance through metrics (like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance) and send alerts when something goes wrong. It tells **what** is happening. It is a part of observability.

# ðŸ’¡Monitoring vs Observability 

| Category       | Monitoring                                   | Observability                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**          | Checking if everything is working as expected else alerting| Understanding why things are happening in the system, Identify the root cause |
| **Data**           | Collects metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and error rates | Collects logs, metrics, and traces to provide a full picture |
| **Example**        | If a server's CPU usage goes above 90%, monitoring will alert us | If a website is slow, observability helps us trace the user's request through different services to find the bottleneck |
| **Benefit**        | Identifies potential issues before they become critical  | Helps diagnose issues and understand system behavior |
| **Tools**          | Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Zabbix, PRTG  | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, FluentBit, Kibana) Splunk, Jaeger, Zipkin, New Relic, Dynatrace, Datadog |


## Monitoring scenarios
- Infrastructure: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
- Applications: Response times, error rates, throughput.
- Databases: Query performance, connection pool usage, transaction rates.
- Network: Latency, packet loss, bandwidth usage.
- Security: Unauthorized access attempts, vulnerability scans, firewall logs.

## Observability scenarios
- Logs: Detailed records of events and transactions within the system.
- Metrics: Quantitative data points like CPU load, memory consumption, and request counts.
- Traces: Data that shows the flow of requests through various services and components.

- Avoidance of vendor lock-in (data portability)




























### Service discovery plugins

Prometheus is bundled with many service discovery plugins.
When building Prometheus from source, you can edit the [plugins.yml](./plugins.yml)
file to disable some service discoveries. The file is a yaml-formatted list of go
import path that will be built into the Prometheus binary.

After you have changed the file, you
need to run `make build` again.

If you are using another method to compile Prometheus, `make plugins` will
generate the plugins file accordingly.

If you add out-of-tree plugins, which we do not endorse at the moment,
additional steps might be needed to adjust the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. As
always, be extra careful when loading third party code.

### Building the Docker image

You can build a docker image locally with the following commands:

```bash
make promu
promu crossbuild -p linux/amd64
make npm_licenses
make common-docker-amd64
```

The `make docker` target is intended only for use in our CI system and will not
produce a fully working image when run locally.

## Using Prometheus as a Go Library

### Remote Write

We are publishing our Remote Write protobuf independently at
[buf.build](https://buf.build/prometheus/prometheus/assets).

You can use that as a library:

```shell
go get buf.build/gen/go/prometheus/prometheus/protocolbuffers/go@latest
```

This is experimental.

### Prometheus code base

In order to comply with [go mod](https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions) rules,
Prometheus release number do not exactly match Go module releases.

For the
Prometheus v3.y.z releases, we are publishing equivalent v0.3y.z tags. The y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v3.0.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.300.0
```

For the
Prometheus v2.y.z releases, we published the equivalent v0.y.z tags.

Therefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v2.35.0 as a library could do:

```shell
go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.35.0
```

This solution makes it clear that we might break our internal Go APIs between
minor user-facing releases, as [breaking changes are allowed in major version
zero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## React UI Development

For more information on building, running, and developing on the React-based UI, see the React app's [README.md](web/ui/README.md).

## More information

* Godoc documentation is available via [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/prometheus). Due to peculiarities of Go Modules, v3.y.z will be displayed as v0.3y.z (the y in v0.3y.z is always padded to two digits, with a leading zero if needed), while v2.y.z will be displayed as v0.y.z.
* See the [Community page](https://prometheus.io/community) for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.

Prometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, is a monitoring system that gathers metrics from targets, evaluates rules, shows results, and triggers alerts when conditions are met.


# Installing as a binary
- Download prometheus here [Prometheus Download Page](https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus)
- Extract
```
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
```
- Create two new directories for Prometheus to use. The /etc/prometheus directory stores the Prometheus configuration files. The /var/lib/prometheus directory holds application data.
```
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```
- Move to extracted directory
```
cd prometheus*
```

```
sudo mv prometheus promtool /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
sudo mv consoles/ console_libraries/ /etc/prometheus/

- Reload Daemon service and enable prometheus to start post reboot
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable prometheus
```

# Managing Prometheus Service
Use below commands to check status, start or stop Prometheus service.
```
sudo systemctl status prometheus
```
```
sudo systemctl start prometheus
```
```
sudo systemctl stop prometheus
```
# Prometheus Configuration File Location
Prometheus YML file is located at following `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
Here is what a default configuration file will look like.

```
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

# Access Prometheus
You can now login to `http://IP_Address:9090` to access Prometheus GUI.
If you can't access the page it can be either because prometheus service is not started or port is not allowed from outside world.

# Commands to open firewall ports on centos 7
- Check ports which are allowed
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
```
- Allow 9090 port
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
